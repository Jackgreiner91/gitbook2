From there you will be prompted to give the duplicated broadcast a new name along with checking which elements of the broadcast you would live to copy over.&#x20;

To change the show date for the duplicated broadcast go into the broadcast's [**setting page**](../broadcasts/settings-page/), then in the general tab update the date and time.&#x20;
