# Organization Media Gallery

Both Organizations and Broadcast's have media galleries.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Supported media formats depend on your particular encoding software but **.png**, **.jpg**, **.gif**, **.svg**, and **.mp4** files will usually work. Please test prior to broadcasting.
{% endhint %}

The Organization Media Gallery is accessible by all broadcasts and should be used to store media that is often reused.&#x20;

To add media drag and drop files onto the teal box.&#x20;

Otherwise click the blue box and locate the files you would like to upload.&#x20;

Files will be uploaded and appear in the media gallery.&#x20;
