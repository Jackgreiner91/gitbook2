# Organization and Broadcast Permissions

## Permissions

There are two categories of roles in Hovercast:&#x20;

* Organization Roles: Add users and guests to your Organization.
* Broadcast Roles: Allow users added to your organization to access certain features.&#x20;

## Organization Roles

Add and remove users into an organization and decide what broadcasts they can access.

* **Admins** can view all broadcasts in an organization as well as manage these user roles
* **Members** can view all Broadcasts in an organization. They **cannot** manage user roles. &#x20;
* **Guests** can only view broadcasts they've been added to. See Broadcast Roles.

## Broadcast Roles

* **Owners** can access everything as well as manage these roles.
* **Editors** can access all areas of a broadcast, but cannot manage roles.&#x20;
* **Moderators** can access only the Audience Screen, Host Screen, and Content Filters.
* **Hosts** can only access the Host Screen and Preview Screen.
* **Viewers** can only access the Preview Screen.

## Adding a User to an Organization&#x20;

To add a user to your organization first go to your [**organization** ](organization-and-broadcast-permissions.md#permissions)and select the users tab.

&#x20;At the bottom of the users page there will be a form to add a new user.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You must be an admin of an Organization to add a new user.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To add a new user enter their Email, assign them an Organization Role, then select their default Broadcast Role.&#x20;

For example:

> If a user you are adding is a **Member**, and given the default broadcast role of a **Host** then they will be able to see every broadcast in the organization, but only be able to access the Host and Preview screen.&#x20;

> If a user is given the Organization Role of a **Guest** and the default broadcasts role of **Moderator** then they will only see the broadcasts they were added to and have access to the audience, host, and content filter pages.&#x20;
